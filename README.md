My name is Jayden and I am currently learning Machine learning from Udacity program:

p2 pending..

Analyze the class and complexity of a given problem, and identify an appropriate algorithm and/or tools to apply towards solving it (e.g. gesture recognition, robot control).
Design an intelligent system that can act on the basis of input data towards optimizing some desired goal metric, with minimal supervision from a human.
Analyze the performance of an intelligent algorithm / system and present key metrics (such as accuracy, recall, computing time, etc. as appropriate) in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing form Handle the entire machine learning pipeline, from data to system:
Gather, clean, and process large data sets to prepare them for analysis
Develop multiple models to describe the data in those sets, validate those models, and compare those models according to standard metrics
Convert the data model into a live system that can process and reach conclusions on real data
Optimize the system based on real-world constraints, such as desired accuracy, efficiency, resource availability, and real-time responsiveness
Deploy the system in a live environment, such as an autonomous car, a recommender system, or a personal assistant
